# harriet-waldron.github.io //Under construction

This is a blog I created for Enspiral Dev Academy, in the first few weeks of the course. 

As this is the first project I worked on, the code is messy in places and reflects my skill level at the time - I have made only a few tweaks to some CSS since completing the given tasks. This blog contains a mix of technical posts and reflections in response to prompts design to build 'human skills'.

I learnt a lot in this process, and it is really interesting to have a reference point to the person I was when I wrote this blog.

Happy reading!
