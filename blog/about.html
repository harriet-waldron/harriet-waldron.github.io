                ..But good job on making it this far! We're all making sense of the chaos in our own time. <br><br> Here 
                  you will find a selection of things written by myself, Harriet, as I attempt to understand web 
                  development. <br><br> When I am not learning to speak to computers, I enjoy meditating in stone 
                  circles, climbing tall rocks, spinning fire, and hanging out with trees.
