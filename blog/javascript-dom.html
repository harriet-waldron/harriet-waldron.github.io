          Welcome to my technical blog post for sprint three, foundations. <br> In this article, I'll attempt to: 
          <ul>
          <li>Use an analogy to describe the differences between HTML, JavaScript and CSS</li>
          <br>
          <li>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</li>
          <br>
          <li>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</li>
          <br>
          <li>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</li>
          <br>
          <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</li>
        </ul>
          <h4> Let's begin! </h4><br>

        <h4>HTML, JavaScript and CSS</h4>
        I like to think of HTML, JS and CSS as enthusiastic builders. They all fill different roles, and rely on each other 
        to get the house feeling strong, looking beautiful and enjoyable to be inside. When they're feeling on form, they work 
        super well together. <br>  
        HTML is a no nonsense, reliable type. They like to lay foundations that won't shake, and are interested in the bones 
        of the structure. There are certain things that HTML will decide, like the names of the rooms, and the content 
        inside them. As long as all the pieces are there, the foundations are laid, and all the doors connect to other rooms, 
        HTML is happy. <br>
        Next they look to CSS. CSS is a designer, they like to decide where the rooms will go, and what layout the house has. 
        As they have heaps of energy and want the house to look beautiful, they also decide everything from paint color to curtains. 
        HTML and CSS work well with each other and are happy to listen to each other's needs (they know that when they 
        don't, the house become chaotic really quickly). <br>
        Next JavaScript comes in. JS likes to design houses that are functional, and can get really creative and high 
        tech with it. Do you want the curtains to open 5 minutes ater your alarm goes off? Do you want your room to change color 
        every time you step on a certain rug? Would you like the fridge to randomly decide for you what you're eating today? 
        JavaScript is the the builder for you. They make a house functional and interactive in whichever way you like, from 
        important tasks and alerts (like a fire alarm) to a more gamified experience. <br>

        <h4>Control flow and loops</h4>
        Controlling the flow of a document means getting to decide the order in which your code runs. Normally a document 
        would run from top to bottom, but along the way there may be certain information that is needed to continue on. If 
        the input requirements aren't met, you wouldn't want the code to continue as nothing happened, and so you need to 
        redirect the flow of the document. Think of it like a busy bank with a queue control manager. To get to any of the 
        tellers you need to get through the manager. You tell them what you need and based off this information they direct 
        you to a certain queue. If you just walked on by this person, you'd both have a difficult time. <br>
        Loops are one way of controlling the flow of a document. They are statements that will continue so long as a condition 
        is true. An easy example is brushing your hair. Once started, you will continue to brush your hair so long as there 
        are still knots. As soon as there are no longer knots, you will stop brushing your hair. A loop is a good way to perform 
        large repetitive tasks, or cycling through data to find information that matches a condition. <br>
        
        <h4>Interacting with the DOM</h4>
        The DOM, or the Document Object Model, represents your entire project, starting with the window and branching down 
        to the smallest elements. It looks similar to a geneology chart, and uses terms like parent and child to describe 
        relationships between elements. Parent elements directly encase the child elements, html would be the parent of 
        head and body, the child of ul (unordered list) would be li, and so on. Window would be the greatest ancestor, a child 
        of which is document. <br> 
        It is through the DOM and the .document key that JavaScript can access the elements it wants to manipulate in HTML 
     and CSS. 
            <!-- For example, If I wanted to change the color of a button everytime it was clicked, I would need to access the 
        button's HTML id selector using <strong> document.getElementById('button')</strong>. <br> Once I have access to the button, I then append an 
        event listener, which would look for a certain action to know when to run. Looking out for a click or a key pressed on 
        the keyboard would be a common example. My code now looks like this; <br>
        <strong> document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click')</strong>. <br> So I have access to the button, and the event listener 
        is making sure that it pays attention when a user clicks this button. But now we need to make sure something happens 
        when the button is clicked. I'm going to add a function called makePretty, and then expand more on this example and how the function 
        works in the section below. <br>
        <strong> document.getElementById('button1').addEventListener('click', makePretty);</strong> <br>
        This line of code is using the DOM to allow me access to my html button element, through it's id 'button1'. The event 
        listener then waits for a user to 'click' this element, and on doing so executes the function makePretty. <br>  -->

        <h4>Functions</h4>
        Functions are reusable blocks of code that allow you to create functionality. They are what make things happen 
        essentially. Functions allow for parameters, which means you can feed them information, and when the information 
        is supplied it is known as an argument. For example, if I wanted to have a simple function that would add two numbers 
        together, it would look like this; <br> <strong>
        function add(a, b) {<br>
        console.log(a + b); <br>
        } <br>
        add(2, 6); <br> </strong>
        8 would be logged to the console. Here a and b are the parameters, which indicate that two pieces of information are 
        expected. When I call the function at the end, 2 and 6 represent a and b. The data given at the end (2, 6), are known 
        as arguments. Functions can also be used to supply information in this way. <br>
        <!-- Lets go back to the button colour change example from before, I'll write it out then explain what its doing. <br><br>
        <strong> function colorChange() { <br>
            return Math.floor(Math.random() * 256); <br>
          } <br>
          <br>
          function makePretty(event){ <br>
            let randomColor = 'rgb(' + colorValue() + ',' + colorValue() + ',' + colorValue() + ')'; <br>
            event.target.style.backgroundColor = randomColor; <br>
          } <br>
          <br>
          document.getElementById('button1').addEventListener('click', makePretty); <br>
        </strong> -->
<div><button id="colorButton">Click me!</button></div>
