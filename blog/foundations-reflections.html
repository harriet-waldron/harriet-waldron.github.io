        <h3>Looking back on the foundations learning journey</h3>

         <p>
           I am reaching the final stages of foundations sprint 5. It has been a month of hard work, learning and growth, 
           and it seems that now is a perfect time for reflection. The following post will explore the learning recieved 
           through each of the core exercises from the last 4 sprints, in a question and answer format. To go deeper on 
           the subjects of identity, emotional intelligence, and neuroplasticity, read the posts with those titles nestled 
           quietly in the 'reflections' directory. Otherwise, read on. Here we go: <br>
          <h4> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core 
          learning?</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Fixed mindset. During the first two sprints I noticed a tendancy within myself toward a fixed mindset, 
              though I didn't know it as such. When we were first encouraged to share our work, I noticed a drive to 
              be both one of the first people outputting content, and for that content to be of a higher quality. I needed to 
              prove to myself and my peers that I was good enough to be here, and that my work was worthy of the time put 
              in. I saw this as an internal perfectionist/competitive drive that was only putting pressure on myself. 
              Since learning about a fixed vs growth mindset, I am able to recognise those drives as reacting in line with 
              a fixed mindset. I believed that I had to prove my intelligence and capability, instead of being comfortable 
              with the idea of being on a learning curve. The outcome did help me improve as I put more effort and time 
              in to upskilling, but it was at the cost of feeling stressed and pressured.</li>

          </ol>

          <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>

          <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>

          <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
            The part I felt most challenged by, was in the first sprint where we had to write about identity, strengths and 
            values. I found it difficult to encapsulate my personality in a succinct way. I feel sometimes nebulous and 
            ever-changing . It was a useful challenge to get to the core of what I believe in and find consistencies there, but 
            I also found it difficult to stay on track with the questions and not over elaborate, or add in extra information. 
            If others were to be reading my blog, how could I just offer them a snapshot of who I am and expect it to be 
            accurate? <br>

          <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web 
          development bootcamp course?</h4>
            I do think the core learning is a vital aspect of understanding how to be at home with ourselves and others. Mostly 
            life involves dealing with other humans, and it always involves the need to know yourself. Learning about how to learn, 
            problem solving and how the brain works of course makes you more able to adapt and grow, and continue an evolving 
            learning journey outside of a school environment. With tech there is always more to learn, always more threads to 
            follow, so it makes perfect sense for a programming school to be preparing students for life outside a classroom. It 
            also will only benefit the wider community and working environments, the more that people inhabiting those spaces understand 
            and value things like emotional intelligence. <br>

          <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used 
          that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer. </h4>
            As I said above, I feel like this core learning is an excellent use of time. I prefer a working landscape 
            where I know how to feel calm, focused, nourished, understood, internally balanced. I prefer understanding 
            how to communicate with and understand those around me. It is hugely beneficial for every aspect of life to 
            be learning about mindfulness, growth mindset, and my own relationship with self. I cannot fault it. And 
            also I enjoyed getting to mix up the subject matter, I feel like huge chunks of tech learning would've 
            been overwhelming. The brain needs time to rest and integrate, and learning techniques to learn, means that 
            all of the things I have yet to learn feel less daunting and more achievable.
