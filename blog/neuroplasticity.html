        <h4>First of all, what is neuroplasticity?</h4>  
          Neuroplasticity is the study of the brain that refers to it's ability to change and adapt, to form and reorganize 
          synaptic connections. The brain responds to learning and experience in a way that makes it physically change shape.
          When we learn, the brain is creating new neural pathways, and the more time we spend revising that lesson or learning 
          adjacent things, the stronger those pathways become. Everytime something is learned or experienced, it brings 
          about the possibility for new neural connections, and new ways for the brain to operate. As it is true that the more 
          neural pathways are accessed, the stronger they become, the same is true for the opposite. The less time the brain 
          spends travelling a neural pathway, the weaker it becomes. That is how forming new habits and thought patterns rewires 
          the brain. To think more about how refocussing the brain can apply to your life, read my post on <a href="emotional-intelligence.html">
          emotional intelligence</a>.
          <br>

          <h4>How does this knowledge make for better learners?</h4>
          Students that understand the nature of the 
          brain and its malleability have been proven to learn faster. This makes sense, because when we know intelligence 
          isn't a fixed state, the world of learning feels a lot more forgiving. When encountering challenges, it helps 
          greatly to know that difficulty is helping you grow and strengthening neural pathways, rather than seeing it as 
          a sign of inability and an intelligence out of your reach. <br> <br>

          Because the brain <em>is</em> incredibly malleable, even just thinking thoughts has an actual physical impact on your 
          body and the shape of the brain. The same neural pathways are strengthened by thinking about a task, almost as equally 
          as doing that task. An example is of one study on finger exercises over the course of 6 weeks, one group 
          physically practiced certain finger strengthening exercises, while the other just thought about it. After 6 weeks, 
          the physical group had improved their finger strength by 30%, but amazingly, the thinkers also improved their 
          strength by 22%. Thought, and the way we intentionally use our brain is powerful. <br> 

          <h4>Mindset</h4>
          So if the way we use our brain is important, then of course, so is mindset. There are two mindsets in particular 
          that matter, which are Growth and Fixed. They represent opposite ways of being. <br> 
          The Growth mindset centers around the knowledge, that intelligence and thought patterns are not fixed things. It is 
          understood that every brain has the capability for improvement and greater depth through consistent and intentional 
          effort, which creates a curiousity and desire for learning and experience. A Fixed mindset on the other hand believes that 
          what you are given is all you have to work with, that brains have a certain capacity for intelligence, emotional capability, 
          adaptability, and it cannot be improved upon. This leads to people feeling the need to prove their worth and intelligence through success, 
          and being unable to move past big challenges or setbacks. The effects of each of these are incredibly far reaching, lets 
          look at a comparison: <br><br>
          Fixed mindset leads to a desire to appear intelligent, and so results in the following behaviours:
          <ul>
            <li>Tendancy to avoid challenges</li>
            <li>Likely to give up when faced with obstacles</li>
            <li>Will see effort as pointless or shameful</li>
            <li>Unable to recieve criticism or use negative feedback</li>
            <li>Can feel threatened by others' success</li>
          </ul>
          This seems to be a rather unhappy way of being, but it is really common. Being unable to work with the inevitable challenges 
          of life means a person is more likely to quit jobs, block themselves off from life paths, feel stunted while others grow, and 
          even try shame others for 'trying too hard'. It works against the heart as well, those who operate as fixed won't put effort 
          into their relationships when problems come, and struggle to work past communication issues, believing people are either right 
          for each other or they aren't. A fixed mindset can also bring with it a whole host of issues around self confidence and belief 
          in the possibility of life to improve. <br><br>
           A Growth mindset on the other hand, is the understanding that the brain can be developed, and so leads to: <br>
           <ul>
            <li>Tendancy to embrace and enjoy challenges</li>
            <li>Likely to keep going when faced with obstacles</li>
            <li>Will see effort as worthwhile and necessary to improve</li>
            <li>Treat criticism as an opportunity to learn</li>
            <li>Can feel empowered and inspired by others' success</li>
          </ul>
          A Growth mindset creates powerful positive feedback loops, and the more effort that is put in, the more learning achieved, the 
          more a sense of success and wellbeing flourishes. Success isn't tied to self image, but rather it can become a byproduct of a 
          masterful way of being. Those with a growth mindset are often willing to treat every area of their life as something that can be 
          improved through continual learning and dedication. Relationships with others and the self will continue to grow and in turn 
          provide more lessons. It is not necessarily the idea that any person could become the best in any field, but that it is impossible 
          to know the far reaching impacts of work and brain training before doing them. And indeed, anyone who has been able to get to and 
          remain excellent in their chosen field, has to be employing a growth mindset. <br>
          Most of us are operating somewhere on the scale between these two oppositing mindsets. Some areas you may be more fixed in, and 
          others feel more growth oriented. The good news is that any person can change their brain, and change their mind. If you can actively 
          choose where you put your energy, why would you not choose the path that encourages welbeing and growth?

           <br> <br>

          <h4>The power of reflection.</h4> 
          This recent understanding about the way we learn shifts the emphasis from purely experiential learning, to the 
          intentional way we reflect on the experiences undertaken. Higher concepts and greater understanding of our own 
          thought processes comes when we - either solo or with others - actively think about what we have learned, what 
          we did well, and what could be improved upon. This process allows our brains to make connections between 
          information, understanding it in new and more relevant ways. Reflection gives us the space to think more abstractly, 
          while our focus isn't purely on finishing the task, and higher level understanding can take place (even when 
          only reflecting for a short time). <br> Another huge benefit of reflecting on your journey, is that it allows you 
          to step back and witness yourself on the learning curve. It is much easier to feel achievements and recognise learning 
          when you make time to reflect regularly, which in turn improves self confidence, and makes goals seem much 
          more manageable. <br>
          <h4>Reflecting with peers.</h4>
          It is well known that teaching a new skill or articulating it to others is a powerful tool in memory retention 
          and the solidifying of our own understanding. It also very quickly highlights gaps in our own understanding of 
          a concepts, prompting us to fill those gaps. Talking with peers who are in the same field of learning allows everyone to access the greater 
          pool of learning, experience and logic.. everyone's brains pick up on concepts in different ways, perhaps it is 
          someone else's thought path that hold the key to your own missing understanding. <br> <br>

          <h4>How does this affect my own learning?</h4> 

          Beginning to learn about these concepts will be hugely helpful for this course in particular, as I have never 
          undertaken such a large body of study in a short space of time, and I will definitely encounter many difficulties 
          along the way. Previously this felt really daunting, but I feel much more encouraged knowing that by brain can 
          handle it so long as I keep trying. Since learning the difference between a fixed and growth mindset, I am now able 
          to be aware of which areas I am exhibiting signs of either, will continue to stive for growth in all areas. <br>
           Learning about the power of reflection was both surprising and not. I have 
          often felt calmer and stronger in my mind after journalling, especially if my brain or heart is very full. But to 
          learn about the science that backs this up, and to know how it shapes learning and accelerates growth, means 
          that I want to make this a daily practice. <br><br>

          These subjects are fascinating and so well worth reading about. I would recommend the articles below, they are 
          well written, informative, engaging and resource rich. The third link is to a short video, where I learned about 
          the study o finger exercises, referenced earlier.
