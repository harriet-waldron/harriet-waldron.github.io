        <h3>Learning about learning, and specifically, about the way you think about your learning.</h3>

        <h4>First of all, what is neuroplasticity?</h4>  
          Neuroplasticity is the study of the brain that refers to it's ability to change and adapt, to form and reorganize 
          synaptic connections. The brain responds to learning and experience in a way that makes it physically change shape.
          <br>
        <h4>The power of reflection.</h4> 
          This recent understanding about the way we learn shifts the emphasis from purely experiential learning, to the 
          intentional way we reflect on the experiences undertaken. Higher concepts and greater understanding of our own 
          thought processes comes when we - either solo or with others - actively think about what we have learned, what 
          we did well, and what could be improved upon. This process allows our brains to make connections between 
          information, understanding it in new and more relevant ways. Reflection gives us the space to think more abstractly, 
          while our focus isn't purely on finishing the task, and higher level understanding can take place (even when 
          only reflecting for a short time). <br> Another huge benefit of reflecting on your journey, is that it allows you 
          to step back and witness yourself on the learning curve. It is much easier to feel achievements and recognise learning 
          when you make time to reflect regularly, which in turn improves self confidence, and makes goals seem much 
          more manageable. <br>
          <h4>Reflecting with peers.</h4>
          It is well known that teaching a new skill or articulating it to others is a powerful tool in memory retention 
          and the solidifying of our own understanding. It also very quickly highlights gaps in our own understanding of 
          a concepts, prompting us to fill those gaps, (and potentially not be embarrassed teaching that same thing next 
          time around). Talking with peers who are in the same field of learning allows everyone to access the greater 
          pool of learning, experience and logic.. everyone's brains pick up on concepts in different ways, perhaps it is 
          someone else's thought path that hold the key to your own missing understanding. <br> <br>

          <h4></h4>
          So reflection is excellent, and so is understanding why it works. Here's where neuroplasticity comes in. This is 
          the
          
          Students that understand the nature of the 
          brain and its malleability have been proven to learn faster. This makes sense, because when we know intelligence 
          isn't a fixed state, the world of learning feels a lot more forgiving. When encountering challenges, it helps 
          greatly to know that difficulty is helping you grow and strengthening neural pathways, rather than seeing it as 
          a sign of inability and an intelligence out of your reach. <br> <br>

          Because the brain <em>is</em> incredibly malleable, even just thinking thoughts has an actual physical impact on your 
          body and the shape of the brain. The same neural pathways are strengthened by thinking about a task, as equally 
          as doing that task. An example is of one study on finger exercises over the course of 6 weeks, one group 
          physically practiced certain finger strengthening exercises, while the other just thought about it. After 6 weeks, 
          the physical group had improved their finger strength by 30%, but amazingly, the thinkers also improved their 
          strength by 22%. Thought, and the way we intentionally use our brain is powerful. <br> <br>

          The Growth mindset centers around this knowledge, that intelligence and thought patterns are not fixed things. 
          Every brain has the capability for improvement and greater depth through consistent and intentional effort. 
          The more neural pathways are accessed, the stronger they become, and the same is true for the opposite. <br> <br>

          How does this affect or help me? <br> <br>

          Beginning to learn about these concepts will be hugely helpful for this course in particular, as I have never 
          undertaken such a large body of study in a short space of time, and I will definitely encounter many difficulties 
          along the way. Previously this felt really daunting, but I feel much more encouraged knowing that by brain can 
          handle it so long as I keep trying. Learning about the power of reflection was both surprising and not. I have 
          often felt calmer and stronger in my mind after journalling, especially if my brain or heart is very full. But to 
          learn about the science that backs this up, and to know how it shapes learning and accelerates growth, means 
          that I want to make this a daily practice.
