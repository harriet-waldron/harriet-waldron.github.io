      <section class="positioning-article"> <p>
        Positioning elements so your web page looks how you want it to is a key aspect of design. It sounds like it should 
        be simple, just tell the elements where to go, right? <br> Well yes.. but it is a little more complicated than that.
        There are several methods to achieving satisfying element layout in CSS, main ones include the keys display, float and 
        positioning. The latter is the one we'll focus on today.
          <br>
        <h6>So what can this little key do? What are the options?</h6>  
        Here are the top 4: <br>
display: static;<br>
display: relative;<br>
display: absolute;<br>
display: fixed;<br>
<br>
Static is the default, you don't need to specify this on css as it is assumed, unless
you wanted to override an inherited rule - where your element has been given orders
by another ruleset. This display means that all the elements are positioned in the 
order they appear in your html. <br>

Let me show you. <br>
First the setup for the html and css: <br>
<div class="screenshots1">

  child elements, which are labled as a green circle, and a red circle.">

  stacked in the top left corner of a yellow rectangle.">

</figure> 
</div>
Relative appears the same at first, because it now positioned relative to it's usual
place, but the difference is that now you can add additional instructions, telling 
it to go more to the left, right, top or bottom of its usual place. So back to the 
rugs, a static rug is in the top left corner of a room, and all the rugs that came
in after it are below and to the left, staying put. Make those same rugs relative 
and suddenly they can move, but only if, and where, you tell them to. Relative 
elements also won't affect the positioning of anything else in the room, but it can can it 
overlap other rugs. <br>
<br>
Absolute elements are positioned in relation to the closest parent element. Parent
elements refer to the ones that encase the element you're trying to move. In this 
case a room. The house is still the entire html document. The parent element that 
an absolute positions itself according to can be either relative or absolute, but 
if there is no positioned parent, the element you are moving will position itself 
in relation to the html document. This rug can move throught the entire house if 
it wants to, and overlap other rugs. Absolute positioning does have an effect on 
the positioning of other elements, as it has been removed from the flow of the document.
note, use absolute positioning wisely, it can be a bit of a mess if overused.
<br>

Absolute and relative positioning work together pretty nicely. If you want 
to use absolute positioning and don't want potential chaos, house them inside of a 
relatively positioned parent container. There is still freedom of movement and the
elements/rugs can overlap others inside the same container/room, but they won't go 
out of the walls of the container/room.   
<br>
Fixed positioning is the final one we will look at. Here the element is also removed
from the document flow, but it is fixed in place and will still be visible when you
scroll. This is good for a navigation menu for example. And as for the rugs.. well 
turns out fixed ones are flying carpets, the kind that want to follow you around 
wherever you go like a dog that wants a walk.
