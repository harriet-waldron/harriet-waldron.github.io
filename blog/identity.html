        <h3>An exploration of my strengths, weaknesses and values.</h3>
      </header>
      <section class="post-article"> <p><h4>What kind of person am I?</h4>
        Such a difficult question to answer. I have spent much time getting to know myself, and one thing I have learned is that people have many sides and contradictions. 
        I am one person in a certain set of 
        circumstances then another will bring out a different expression of those same sides. These descriptions are to be taken as a loose snapshot 
        of an ever morphing being. This exploration has been as much for myself as it has been to answer the questions from an EDA exercise, and as 
        such, it is rather long. Pick and choose as you will. 
        <br><br>
        
        <h4>How I relate to others:</h4>
        According to Myers-briggs I fluctuate between an ENFP-A and and INFP-A. The campainer and the mediator. This means I am either extroverted or 
        introverted, I am more intutive than sensing, I feel more than I think, and I perceive the world more than than judge it. I am more assertive than turbulent. The strengths of the 
        campainer and mediator alike lie in connecting with and understanding people. Emotionally led, optimistic and curious, I'm interested in 
        people and the way they operate. I find it easy to empathise and understand complex emotion, and am able to hold space for others well. I highly 
        value open communication, it makes everyone's life easier when we understand each other and don't conceal feelings, and I think healthy conflict is a good thing.
        I encourage spaces where people can drop away layers of hardness and pretense, and allow themselves to be soft and to be met as they are - 
        authenticity makes for happier beings and more nourishing friend groups / workplaces / anywhere humans exist. <br>
        I am a loyal friend, I encourage others to thrive, but am discerning with those I invest real time in. Kindness and respect toward everyone is 
        important, but there are so many excellent people out there, so I will not hold on to people who don't treat me well. <br>
        I believe the need for play, creativity and movement are vital aspects of my being, these expressions often so well entertwined. 
        I love to dance, I do yoga every day, running and swimming feel freeing - it is how I feel at home in my body.
        Amidst the ever changing lives we individually live, there is the ancient slowness of life revealing itself at it's own pace. The body has its 
        own wisdom and it must be taken care of and be allowed to rest. I believe that life is much more full than the work we do or identities we 
        assume. 
        <br><br>
        <h4>My chosen community:</h4>
        A culture that I am a part of because it aligns deeply with my values, is the burner community. 
        Burner culture is born from the Burning Man festival ethos. This festival, and those that branch from it, is built around eleven principles. 
        These are radical inclusion, <br>
        gifting, <br>
        decommodification, <br>
        radical self-reliance, <br>
        radical self-expression, <br>
        communal effort, <br>
        civic responsibility, <br> 
        leaving no trace, <br>
        participation, <br>
        immediacy,<br>
        and consent. <br>
        In general I enjoy spending time with others who believe in and embody these principles, and I think these ideas create a better world.
        A culture of people who include others from all backgrounds and belief systems creates diversity, interest and empathy. Gifting is more about 
        how you give your time, energy and show others you care, a focus on giving is better than a focus on taking. Self reliance means everyone takes 
        care of their own needs, does their own self work and emotional labour, so others aren't asked to do it for them, or clean up their messes. Self 
        expression makes for creative and communicative environments where people feel safe to come as they are. Communal effort is about connection and 
        working for a collective good, lifting others up means everyone can rise. Participation is about the growth you experience when you include yourself.
        Civic responsibility and leave no trace mean taking responsible action for the society, the environment and the planet in which we exist, and minimising negative footprints. 
        Immediacy is a stepping in to life 
        approach, whether it is enthusiastically living for the moment or doing a job sooner rather than later. Finally consent is vital and obvious, 
        and extends to so many small areas of life. <br>
        People who live in awareness of these values generally create spaces that feel safe, productive, celebratory, kind, playful and enjoyable, 
        without ignoring responsibility to ourselves, each other, and the environment.
        I have never known such nourishing friendships as the ones I have cultivated with my burner friends, and I have never known such wholesome, colorful, 
        silly, joyful, and often potent, celebrations of life as the the events my community holds.

        <h4>An example that illustrates my working identity:</h4>
        Last year I wanted to be an artist. I have always loved making art, and have always been relatively good at it. I took three months off work 
        with the idea that I needed to give it a good shot to see if I could actualise this dream. I was really excited, I had so many ideas and plans. 
        I came up with strategies, wrote plans and lists. And then didn't do anything. So I came up with new strategies, new plans, new lists.. still 
        nothing. And the cycle continued. I really struggled to self motivate and it took a huge hit on my confidence. How would I be able to do 
        anything if I couldn't make myself do something I enjoyed so much? My plans felt so realistic, was I just that lazy that I couldn't follow a 
        simple schedule? So the three months went by, I made some art but never achieved the levels of productivity or output I had initially visualised. 
        I began to give up on that dream, I clearly wasn't cut out for 
        the high levels of motivation a self employed artist needs to become anything great. It felt pretty bad, but I laughed it off and went back to 
        making coffee and wondering what my new life purpose would be. <br>
        A little while later I started coding. I enrolled in an online course, and soon after enrolled in Dev Academy. 
        How would this be any different though? I was essentially doing the same thing, studying from home, until EDA started in a few months. Turns out 
        it was radically different, I was studying whenever I had time, and was continualy excited to do so. There were days that I would finish a 10 
        hour shift at the cafe and be so excited to go home and study. <br>
        I realised there were a few key differences in the way I was now operating. For 
        starters, I was working towards a goal that intimidated me slghtly. I had heard a lot about bootcamp and wasn't sure that I'd be up to the 
        challenge, especially after the last time I tried to prove to myself I could do something, I failed. So I wanted to work hard and upskill 
        before beginning. I was now also working within a given structure. There were clear goals and achievement points. I was given the material 
        to learn and an order in which to complete the tasks. In this case I was only accountable to myself and a computer program designed to 
        motivate, but it was enough. I no longer felt I could just put off my self improvement because noone else was watching. I no longer felt like 
        I already knew what I was doing and so didn't need to try hard. My brain loved learning something from scratch, I barely knew my way around a 
        computer at the best of times, and was typing at about 6 words per minute when I began. <br>
        This clarified for me some aspects of the way I operate. I have always known myself to be a person who struggles with procrastination, 
        time management, self accountability and placing more value in dreams and plans that in action and completion. I have now learnt far more about 
        how to work with that. I like to work independantly, but I do struggle to create my own work and stay on track. I like to be given tasks that I 
        find meaningful, ones that challenge me and give clear outlines of timelines / deadlines. I work really hard and thrive under the right 
        circumstances. <br>
        I am adaptable, but don't work well in spaces that are highly critical, stressful, competitive or hectic. While outwardly I can be highly productive 
        in competition, it is at an inward cost. I can be overly perfectionist, and will hold myself to high standards, wanting to be first in class. I had
        often been praised in school for intelligence, and while I don't think that is particulary relevant to being a good learner, it has shaped me in a way 
        that means competition against others creates an unhealthy internal drive to be praised as the best or smartest. 
        I do work well in places that value creativity and individual expression.
        <br><br>
        <h4>An example from when I was trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance  
        or tension:</h4>
        Once upon a time I was a bartender, working in a busy, popular bar. It was the kind of environment where the whole team relied on each other 
        to get through busy periods. This created a strong bond as coworkers, but it also meant that it was felt keenly when someone wasn't pulling their 
        weight. One of the managers was like that, he seldom did any work, and everyone had to work as though we were a person short, this naturally 
        bred resentment. No one liked working with him, for this, and also that he had a very negative temperament. The more time that went on, the less 
        I was able to respect him, and the less patience I had for him. It was affecting my enjoyment of my work, and so I decided to talk to him. <br>
        I was 
        advised not to by everyone, as they all thought he could react badly, but it had gone unaddressed too long. I value constructive confrontation. 
        I pulled him aside one evening and gently but plainly outlined the issue. I told him I was struggling to respect his work ethic and didn't enjoy 
        our shifts together due to his unfriendliness. I explained that I would much prefer to be able to respect my manager, feel like we were all working 
        together and not feel nervous of approaching him with issues. I then asked if he was receptive to this, and if he felt like he needed any support 
        in working towards a healthier environment. I asked for his point of view and was open to hearing him. 
        This was pretty nerve wracking, but ended up working really well. He was willing to listen, explained some of his behaviours and from then on 
        was mostly a really good manager and stepped up his productivity. He expressed that he appreciated the honesty and respected my effort.
        This is not the first time I have used that strategy with a manager, and it generally works. <br> I have found if you approach people with kindness 
        and willingness to listen, understand and work together on an issue, it is much easier to face interpersonal conflicts.
        <br><br>
        <h4>An example of when my ethics have clashed:</h4>
        When I was travelling in Australia, I found myself living in a community in Melbourne, known as Crunchytown. It was an incredible place, a 
        warehouse filled with creatives, travellers, eccentrics and hippies. The entire place had been built up from nothing, inside there was a treehouse, 
        rooms hidden behind library shelves, a carpentry workshop, a circus area, a huge kitchen, a music studio, wardrobe narnia rooms and winding staircases 
        and so much art. To keep up to 40 people housed and fed, we lived off dumpster diving, collected rainwater to wash, did daily warehouse maintenance, 
        gardening, building and creating. It was an exciting place to live, and the communal effort required of you was high. <br> To run this kind of place 
        you need a strong leader, Sam. He was magnetic and a powerful personality. Crunchytown aligned with so many of my ethics, we lived with minimal impact 
        on the planet, creativity and self expression was highly encouraged, inclusion and participation almost enforced. It was that last point that made me 
        question my ethics. Because the warehouse required such continual upkeep, everyone was expected to give most of their daily lives to the 
        community. Whenever Sam had decided we all needed to do a mission, everyone had to join in or be almost shamed. If you didn't spend most of 
        your time helping cook, or cleaning, or building / creating things, you would get called out for it. It was a confusing thing, recognising why 
        everyone had to pitch in, and seeing how much good it created, but feeling like my individuality and freedom were being taken away. The way I 
        dealt with this differed each time. 
        Mostly I joined in, I usually had the energy and it was pretty fun to work communally. On days I felt sick or off, I would leave the warehouse 
        so I wasn't thought of as being lazy. I decided in this case to not discuss with the Sam the effect his tactics had, the mentality he created was a necessary fuel 
        to keep the space running, and too many people believed in the system. People who wanted to change things were reminded they didn't have to live there if they didn't like the rules.  
         <br> It was an interesting experience to get to see some of my ethics tested in a way where they were overly 
        magnified. I do believe in communal effort and participation, but not at the cost of individuality and not when there is no room for opting out.
        Eventually I left Crunchytown. Grateful for the experiences and the people I met, but understanding much more about the kind of communities I want 
        to live in in the future.
