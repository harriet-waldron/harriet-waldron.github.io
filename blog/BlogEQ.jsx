        <h3>An exploration on EQ versus IQ </h3>

      <p>Emotional intelligence is about how we understand and process emotion, and how we utilise those skills during social interaction. EQ is 
        a broader spectrum, body and awareness centred view, whereas IQ is a more narrow, mind and memory centred view. Both require focus and a 
        developed skill base, and those who develop both in conjunction with each other are well set to become effective leaders and excell in 
        their chosen field. Emotional intellingence may very well be more important in area area with which you are working with people, but has the 
        added component of developing self mastery - which carries across to all areas of life.

        Using definitions from <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/iq-or-eq-which-one-is-more-important-2795287:">VeryWellMind</a> blog:  <br></br><br></br>
        Traditional intelligence (IQ) is measured by proficiency in; <br></br>
        Visual and spatial processing <br></br>
        Knowledge of the world <br></br>
        Fluid reasoning <br></br>
        Working memory and short-term memory <br></br>
        Quantitative reasoning <br></br>
        <br></br>
        While Emotional Intelligence is quantified by proficiency in; <br></br>
        Identifying emotions <br></br>
        Evaluating how others feel <br></br>
        Controlling one's own emotions <br></br>
        Perceiving how others feel <br></br>
        Using emotions to facilitate social communication <br></br>
        Relating to others <br></br>

        There are three branches to developing emotional intelligence; attention training, self mastery and crafting mental habits. Lets explore. <br></br>
        
       <h4>Attention: </h4>
        Familiar to those who have studied yoga or any art of mindfullness meditation, training your attention is a powerful way to hone your mind.
        Our attention flows like a river wherever we direct it, and paying attention to what is going on is the only way to understand. Understanding 
        our own emotional landscape requires paying attention to the body, and the felt experience. When you experience frustration or anger for example, 
        ask yourself; where does that sit in my body? How is my body reacting? Has my breathing changed? Sometimes it is the only way to understand the 
        core of an emotion. Perhaps 
        you feel heavy and don't know why. Could you be disappointed? 
        Training your attention is getting to know yourself, and from there you can 
        respond in a way that meets your needs. <br></br> For example, perhaps I am feeling jealousy, but when I sit with that emotion, and explore how it feels 
        in my body I am actually feeling fear. Then I can ask myself why, and perhaps I am afraid of not being good enough. From there I know better 
        how to treat myself with kindness, self soothe, recognise where I need to do some self work or address an external issue - this can't be done if 
        I hear only the jealousy and seek to remove the external source of my pain. 
        Once you are tuned in with the felt experience of your emotional landscape, it both helps you to observe the emotion without being consumed by it, 
        and to better empathise with what others may be feeling. <br></br>
        The vital key with attention training is practicing to pay attention without judgement. It is difficult at first, but know that there is no need 
        to try and change what you are thinking or feeling. Noticing it is enough. Judgement can create unnecessary layers of complexity to deal with, 
        e.g. "I feel disappointed xyz didn't work out, I feel stupid. Oh wait, I shouldn't be thinking that, I should be more resilient. I can't 
        even get positive self talk right, maybe I do suck..." It can pretty quickly turn in to a spiral. Attention training means you can notice the 
        emotion as it is, without needing to change it. This non-judgemental space creates a calm platform from which to take action if needed.
        <br></br>
        <h4>Self Mastery:</h4>
        Self knowledge is the first step towards self mastery. You will come to understand how you react to certain situations, how you operate under 
        stress, what makes you calm etc. You then can use this knowledge to develop effective strategies for yourself. You will learn how to self 
        regulate when experiencing intense emotions, or recognise the triggers that can make you react. Learning to self soothe is an important skill, 
        many people only ever seek reassurance from other people and never learn how to reach a calm space internally. <br></br> Self mastering means tooling 
        yourself up with the means to get to the calm, clear state of mind. <br></br>
        Imagine you are feeling angered by a coworker, or your boss. Nothing will be achieved if you end up yelling or storming out, will it? It would 
        be far more effective to recognise that emotion, and discuss constructively with the person triggering you. Perhaps you need to work on your 
        communication tactics together, perhaps the trigger was not even related to that person, but that they reminded you of someone in your life 
        you have conflict with. Maybe you're just really hungry. It is pointless to react badly when you consider that, right? It only creates far more 
        stress. Self mastery also helps mitigate miscommunication and confusion. If you can calmly talk through an issue, or explain to someone how an 
        action made you feel, or explain why you do certain behaviours yourself, everyone involved can clearly understand each other, and there is no 
        room to be upset by an assumption.
        <br></br>
        <h4>Mental Habits:</h4>
        So you know what your thought patterns look like at this point, you know what makes you anxious or self critical. What if you had the power to change them? 
        Oh wait, you do! Our brains are incredibly malleable, and just like a physical habit that you can form or break, our mental habits work the same 
        way. Perhaps you always doubt yourself when you are meeting a new person, despite the fact that you know you can make friends. What if everytime 
        you thought "Oh they're gonna think I'm so boring/awkward/weird", you approached the interaction with curiosity and instead thought "Everyone 
        is so different, I wonder if this new person and I will get along well". This new thought pattern takes all the pressure off you for leading the 
        interaction and being good enough, and instead places the focus on genuinely meeting that person to see if you are a good fit. There are lots of 
        people out there, it shouldn't be a big deal that you won't get along with them all. <br></br>
        Or else, what if a self deprecating thought came up, about why you can't achieve the task at hand, and instead of being consumed by it and giving 
        up, you took a mental step back and considered the negative thought against other, positive evidence that suggests that you can do the task?
        <br></br> Breaking mental habits is difficult, but a way to override them is through attention. Every time you notice a thought pathway, take a step back 
        and observe. You don't need to change it, just step outside of it and see it for what it is. Next time, maybe you can observe the thought, and in the space you have created, there is room for a new thought - one you choose.
         Each time you catch the thought and step away from it, you are strengthening the pathway that diverts the river of that thought. 
        Soon enough the new pathway will be strong enough that your brain travels it more easily, and eventually it will become much stronger than your 
        old negative thought. And this pathway leads wherever you want it to, that is how you eventually override a negative thought with a positive thought.
        As I said this can be a difficult and slow process, but it gets easier with time. It leads only to good things, when you can consciously choose 
        and put energy in to the mental habits that make your mind a calmer, stronger and friendlier place.
        <br></br>
        <h4>How this relates to others and the workplace:</h4>
        Emotionally intelligent people have been proven to excell in whichever area they put their mind to, and are generally seen as more trustworthy, 
        better friends, better leaders, happier and more likable people. This means you're more likely to get jobs, promotions, and gain influence. When 
        you can effectively listen to and understand yourself, you can too with other people - and people like to feel seen and heard. Being an effective 
        communicator makes life easier but also streamlines your work experiences with other people. Conflicts can be managed, and people aren't made to 
        do your emotional work for you. Mastery of the self makes for a clear and confident mindset, allowing you to network or tackle the big projects. 
        Strong mental habits mean that you aren't holding yourself back by thought patterns created from previous trauma. You can move forward and achieve 
        the life you want to. <br></br>
        Nothing is a quick fix, and working on your emotional intelligence isn't guaranteed to give you your every desire, but it is setting yourself 
        up with a better chance and definitely making aspects of your life easier. <br></br>
        In my opinion, developing emotional intelligence is one of the best ways to get the most out of life. So much is built by the connections we 
        make with others and the relationship we cultivate with ourselves.</p>
