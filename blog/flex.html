        <h3><em>(A poem I found on the street one day.)</em></h3>
    
        <p class="poem">You are a pair of headphones in the here and now of Cuba Street. You are a winter-worn woolen jersey, hand sewn and once forgotten in a beautiful bora wardrobe. Then remembered for a week, when your friend’s mum came round for tea and cake and said you looked cold (and pale and skinny)
          and fuck her. You donated that jersey to the Salvation Army. <br>
          You felt good. <br>
                Really fucking good about it. <br>
                      For a day. Maybe two. <br>
          Then you remembered your beautiful bluetooth headphones in the here and now of Willis Street. But you still felt IT! 
          IT: the great non-consensual notification on your consciousness. IT was burning into your upper thigh; the abrupt vibration of your phone. <br>
          IT read: AT YOUR REQUEST <br>
          I WALKED THE NARROW FOREST <br>
          WITH A PEACH IN MY POCKET AND <br>
          A TORN OUT, SECOND-HAND COPY <br>
          OF THE LOVESONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK <br>
          <br>
          You remembered. There was a lamp post flickering to the bricks, as if to say, stuttering; “I’m here to give you light.”
          Then. A man appeared with slippered feet and silk shirt sleeves. His name was Elijah Holstein. <br>
          He held out his hand and his hand was holding an envelope. <br>
          “I found this thumb tacked to the bulletin board of a midnight cafe wall and well, I thought you should have it.” <br>
          It was a piece of paper, coffee stained and torn at the edges. It read: <br>
          If you dare, ask a stranger; what is the name of the wind? <br>
          <br>
          He told you with a sad and nearly silent sigh that he was afraid. Afraid of the elemental ferocity held by the TREES, Rata and Pine; their circle of leaves, their circle of earthly dreams; their protection around the true names of nature. <br>
          You said in the there and then, something like “fuck off, I’m busy.” <br>
          but actually was, “here’s my number.” He persisted but more talking to himself. <br> 
          “Perhaps I should ask the forest in synonyms and secret symbols like cherimoya apple whispered to a piece of paper then pulped and pitted into a poem then gifted and regifted on a Wednesday afternoon to the esoterically encrusted barista of Retrogrove Cafe.” <br>
          He left with a finger pointing at the moon above Mt. Victoria. You were left holding the envelope and wondering, if you should reply… <br>
          and if the barista would know how...   <br>
          <br>
