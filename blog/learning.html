        <h4>Updated learning plan</h4>
          <ul><li>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</li></ul>
          I'm still figuring a lot of this out, as I come to understand myself and my strengths better. I definitely enjoy the 
          design aspect of website building. I enjoy making things look good much more than I enjoy creating back end structure, 
          though that is also satisfying. So far I've had the most fun with CSS and color. I am really interested in the core skills, and I 
          would like to pursue a path working for companies that really uphold those values, or otherwise helping to facillitate 
          those environments. Some blend of tech and looking after people and getting to create beautiful websites / apps for people whose 
          product or ethics I believe in. As an addition to the skills I learn in Dev Academy, I am planning to go deeper into 
          web design in the future.
          <ul><li>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li></ul>
          I think my strengths are still around connection and authentically relating with others. I am hoping this means I will 
          work well in pairs and group formats, though I will potentially have to work through the frustration of people not meeting my 
          expectations. Communication helps with everything and I feel comfortable continuing to expand my communication skills. 
          I have found that one of my strengths is focus, but I have yet to discover what that is like for longer hours than I am 
          used to every day. I have also discovered that the limitations I outlined in the previous learning plan and identity 
          section have not proven to be a problem at all. I have stayed on task, finished projects, remained motivated and productive.
          This is great, but it also means that I have new limitations to discover in bootcamp. I am a bit nervous about it and 
          don't know yet how I will react to a lot of stress, or if I'm unable to understand a concept, or if I have interpersonal issues 
          with others, or if I'll try to live on coffee and not remain healthy. I may become really hard on myself and strive for 
          perfectionism, or I may relax and feel the growth mindset. I might struggle with time management, or confidence, or 
          it may be totally fine. I feel proud of how I've worked through old limitations so far, and will update this 
          learning plan when I am able identify the new areas of weakness.
          <ul><li>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</li></ul>
          I think getting to bootcamp on time every day will be something I have to manage quite closely. I have often displayed 
          poor time management skills in the past, and I as I have just moved out of town I don't yet have a clear strategy on 
          how to get in everyday. I am planning on setting myself up with a structure that leaves a lot of time in the morning and 
          so allows for error without impacting my attendance. I am much better in this area than I used to be, but it still requires 
          intentional effort.
          <ul><li>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</li></ul>
          I would like to get better at speaking in front of groups of people. I can do okay with small groups but bigger ones make 
          me nervous, especially if I don't feel confident that what I'm sharing is correct. I would also like to improve upon 
          my leadership skills, I often lack confidence that I would be the right person to lead a group and so usually take 
          a supporting role.
          <ul><li>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li></ul>
          My expectations are to feel supported throughout the process. I would expect help if I'm struggling to understand concepts, 
          and honest feedback on the areas I can improve in. More than just technical skills, I would like for the bootcamp team to 
          feel comfortable expressing areas in which I can improve my core skills too. I would appreciate compassion, follow through 
          where necessary, and keeping to scheduled meetings.
          <ul><li>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</li></ul>
          I believe that I will be able to cope mentally and physically with bootcamp, but for that to happen I know I need to 
          stick to healthy habits around rest, food and exercise. I need to find a balance between allowing myself to be authentic 
          in whichever state I'm in, and leaving my personal life at the door in order to focus. Here I make a commitment to myself 
          to uphold the habits I have been cultivating throughout foundations, and put effort in to remaining on stable ground. I need 
          to remember to take regular breaks for my eyes and my body. I will check in with and look after the people around me when 
          I have the capacity to do so, and will set clear boundaries with myself and others when I am at a lower capacity. I will 
          feel good about reaching out for help and giving help when asked. If stress should become too present for me, I will seek help 
          from those more equipped to help, and not make it anyone else's problem.
          <br><br>
        <h4>First learning plan</h4>
          I have identified that my strengths lie in communication, seeking community, understanding and empathising with others, and compassion. I am a 
          hard worker under the right circumstances, but when not, I tend more towards planning than action. I am not good at finishing projects unless 
          given a deadline and accountability, and I need nourishing environments to thrive. I am generally really good at keeping myself healthy, and plan 
          to continue giving myself a good basis of exercise, nutrition and rest to work from. <br> When things become overwhelming, coping strategies I have 
          include rest via a short walk, stepping outside, meditating, stretching or talking to a friend who understands the study - depending on the time 
          available. If the problem becomes more than momentary stress and I need to reach out for help, I will do so by keeping my facilitator informed 
          on how I am doing, seeking help with the work from within my cohort if applicable, or scheduling one of the counsilling sessions offered by EDA. <br>
          I do not have outside commitments that I need to schedule in. <br>
          I do not yet know what to expect of my facilitator other than a basic level of compassion, giving constructive feedback, listening to requests 
          for help, responding to messages when practical, critiquing or praising my work as is appropriate and being on time for scheduled meetings. 
          I make a commitment to keep myself on track with my schedule, show up to class every day I am supposed to, maintain focus, complete projects 
          on time and remain kind to those around me. <br>
          Wherever possible I will look after those around me by checking in with teammates, providing help to those who ask and not taking out my stress on anyone around me. <br>
          I am aware that this learning plan will shift and grow, as I grow in to the learning journey and better understand myself and what is required of me.
