      <section class="post-article"> <p>DRAFT //////    <br> So I have identified that my strengths lie in communication, seeking community, understanding and empathising with others, and compassion. I am a 
        hard worker under the right circumstances, but when not, I tend more towards planning than action. I am not good at finishing projects unless 
        given a deadline and accountability, and I need nourishing environments to thrive. I am generally really good at keeping myself healthy, and plan 
        to continue giving myself a good basis of exercise, nutrition and rest to work from. When things become overwhelming, coping strategies I have 
        include rest via a short walk, stepping outside, meditating, stretching or talking to a friend who understands the study - depending on the time 
        available. If the problem becomes more than momentary stress and I need to reach out for help, I will do so by keeping my facilitator informed 
        on how I am doing, seeking help with the work from within my cohort if applicable, or scheduling one of the counsilling sessions offered by EDA. 
        I do not have outside commitments that I need to schedule in.
        I do not yet know what to expect of my facilitator other than a basic level of compassion, giving constructive feedback, listening to requests 
        for help, responding to messages when practical, critiquing or praising my work as is appropriate, being on time for scheduled meetings. 
        I make a commitment to keep myself on track with my schedule, show up to class every day I am supposed to, maintain focus, complete projects 
        on time and maintain a pleasant disposition. <br>  ///////  DRAFT  </p>
